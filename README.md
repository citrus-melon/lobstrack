# Lobstrack
_Lobst track of an item? Worry not, Lobstrack will have your back!_

A simple-to-use, mobile/QR code-centric asset tracking platform desgined for everyday use at small scales such as FRC teams.

Built with Supabase, SvelteKit, and CapacitorJS.

## Purpose
The original goal of this project is to remove the friction in the process of updating an FRC team lab inventory, making it much more feasible to maintain its accuracy. QR codes bridge the gap between the "virtual world" of an inventory and the physical world, making it easier to make them reflect each other.

## Features
- [x] Organize and browse items in nested hierarchy (eg Shelf > Container > Example Item)
- [x] Scanning/generation of serialized QR code stickers
  - [x] Quickly identify and perform operations on items (such as updating location) by scanning
  - [ ] Double as "Property of / if found please return" labels
- [ ] Attach notes, details, and files to items
- [ ] Find items with full-text search
- [x] Easily share and reference items by link with web interface
- [ ] Track version history and audit log
